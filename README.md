### Howdy, I'm Joel! 👋

<!--
**Jabitzen/Jabitzen** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 😄 I'm a software developer with 3 years of mechatronics under my belt, and now the expertise from a full-stack coding bootcamp with App Academy!
- ⚡ I love to work with all things tech, and I am a huge fan of Movies! Feel free to reach out!
